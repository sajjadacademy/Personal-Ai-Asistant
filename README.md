**⚡ Sajju AI Assistant**
Your Personal AI Coding & Research Copilot

**Publisher: Sajjad Academy**

**🧠 Overview**

Sajju AI Assistant is a personal, customizable AI desktop assistant designed to behave exactly the way you want.
With built-in support for system prompts, themes, and dynamic response behavior, this tool lets you define how the AI should think, act, and respond.

You simply set a system prompt in the settings—
and the assistant will follow that personality, style, and expertise in every answer.

For example:

-Act like a coder → it replies with coding solutions
-Act like an English poet → it replies in poetic form
-Act like a senior AI engineer → it gives advanced AI responses
-Act like a researcher → it writes deep analytical explanations
-This makes Sajju AI Assistant a creative, flexible, and powerful productivity tool.
